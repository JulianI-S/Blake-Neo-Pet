If I didn't do it properly since writing this; I wasn't sure where to put the test cases, class diagram, etc. So I'm just putting them on the GitHub for now.

KNOWN BUGS:
Blake sometimes doesnt 'see' food despite being within range
Sometimes Blake will get close to a certain food item and either rapidly move around it or stop altogether
If blake is going too fast,the above problem is more prevalent (why agility doesnt currently affect speed)
Food image is not transparent, change it to 'juul.png' if it gets too annoying

The program in its current state is incredibly janky, sorry about that, wish I had more time to polish it but still proud of the work put in so far.
lots of comments in driver in attempt to make the code more readable
